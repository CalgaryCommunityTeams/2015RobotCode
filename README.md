This is our 2015 FRC robot code. We are using [atalibj](https://github.com/frc-west/atalibj) to help with developement.

To use this code, clone the repository and add it as a project in Eclipse or Netbeans. You will need to use Eclipse to deploy the code, as of right now.

Be sure you have the FRC [plugins](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/7885/l/79405-installing-the-java-development-tools) and other development tools installed.
